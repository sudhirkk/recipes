This rice Pulav is rich with vegetables and the aroma of various spices. Quick to prepare and can be enjoyed with Raita salad.

## Ingredients

 * Rice (Basmati rice smells and tastes better)  - 2 cups
 * Pulav spice (I use MTR Pulav Masala) - 2 teaspoons 
 * Cardomom powder - 1 teaspoon
 * Cloves - 2 or 3 seeds
 * Cinnamon stick - 1 small piece
 * Vegetable oil - 1 tablespoon
 * Ghee (Clarified button) - 2 teaspoons
 * Cashew nuts - 3 ounces
 * Onions (sliced and minced) - one half
 * Ginger (minced) - 1 tablespoon full
 * Vegetables - assorted, cut into medium sized pieces - 4 cups
 
 

## Procedure
 * Soak the Basmati rice in a bowl for 20 minutes 
 * In an Instantpot, add oil and select the Saute option. Opt for 30 or so minutes so that it lasts enough time to saute the vegetables. When the oil is heated up, add cut onions and ginger until it turns light brown. Add vegetables and the spices such as cloves, cinnamon stick, cardomom powder and the Pulav spice. Stir is as necessary.
 * When the vegetables are some what mixed up with the spices, add rice to it. You can add some more oil or butter as needed. Make sure that the rice get slightly roasted in oil / butter.
 * Add 2 cups of water to the rice - vegetable mix and close the Instantpot and cook for 5 minutes in high pressure. Do a quick pressure release after 5 minutes.
 * In a pan, add ghee and cachew nuts to roast them to golden hue. Add the cashews and the heated up ghee to the rice. Mix well.
 

Pulav is best with Raita and/or Chickpea saute.
